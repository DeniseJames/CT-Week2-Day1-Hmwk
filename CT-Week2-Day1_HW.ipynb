    "The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to a given number n. It was devised by the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes in the 3rd century BCE. The algorithm works by iteratively marking as composite (i.e., not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting from 2.\n",

    "Move to the next number that is still marked as prime (in this case, 3), and repeat the process: mark all its multiples (except the number itself) as not prime.\n",
    "Continue this process until you've processed all numbers up to n.\n",
    "At the end of this procedure, the indices of the is_prime list that hold the value True correspond to prime numbers."

    "   \n",
    "   - It goes up to `n+1` because `range` in Python is exclusive at the end, so `n+1` ensures that `n` is included in the range if it's a multiple of `p`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The step is `p`, which means every `p`th number from the start (i.e., `p*p`) will be considered. This allows the loop to iterate over all multiples of `p`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`for i in range(...):`**:\n",
    "   - This loop iterates over each multiple of `p` from `p*p` to `n`. For each of these multiples, the inner part of the loop (not shown in your provided code, but typically something like `is_prime[i] = False`) marks them as not prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, once a prime `p` is identified, this loop goes through and marks all of its multiples above `p*p` and up to `n` as not prime. This is a core step of the Sieve of Eratosthenes, ensuring that by the end of the algorithm, only prime numbers remain unmarked.\n"
