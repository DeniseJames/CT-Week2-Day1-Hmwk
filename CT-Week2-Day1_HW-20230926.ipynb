    "multiples (except the number itself) as not prime. Continue this process until you've processed all numbers up to n.\n",

    "1. **`range(p*p, n+1, p)`**:\n",

    "   - The step is `p`, which means every `p`th number from the start (i.e., `p*p`) will be considered. This allows the loop to iterate over all multiples of `p`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`for i in range(...):`**:\n",
    "   - This loop iterates over each multiple of `p` from `p*p` to `n`. For each of these multiples, the inner part of the loop (not shown in your provided code, but typically something like `is_prime[i] = False`) marks them as not prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, once a prime `p` is identified, this loop goes through and marks all of its multiples above `p*p` and up to `n` as not prime. This is a core step of the Sieve of Eratosthenes, ensuring that by the end of the algorithm, only prime numbers remain unmarked.\n"
